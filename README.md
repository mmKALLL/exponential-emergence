Aesthetics: discovery, challenge

# How to play:

Click on the actions to gain resources, do the goals to unlock new actions, complete all goals to reach the next stage.

Each life lasts for one real-time minute. However, some of your progress is carried to all future runs. Different levels of the emergence ladder also have synergies with each other.

Although the game is very minimalistic, the core data is based on actual research into organism efficiency and body mass. It is a great exercise in systems thinking, with some mind-bending required in the later levels.
